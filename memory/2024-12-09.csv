If you attempt to cancel your ticket 10 hours before the flight and it is beyond the 24-hour window from when you booked, you may be subject to cancellation fees or penalties, especially if you have a non-refundable ticket. Always check the specific terms and conditions of your ticket for details on cancellation policies and potential fees."
